# Overview

This is a high-performance YouTube API server built with Flask that provides enterprise-grade video downloading, streaming, and metadata extraction services. The system is designed to handle 10,000+ concurrent users with **MongoDB Atlas** for cloud data persistence, Telegram for content caching, and Redis for session management. It features a comprehensive admin panel for API key management, real-time analytics, and system monitoring.

## Recent Changes (August 2025)
- ✅ **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: Telegram Cache System Operational**: Resolved critical import conflicts and implemented direct HTTP API calls for Telegram Bot integration
- ✅ **Cache-First Architecture Working**: Three-tier system fully functional (Telegram → MongoDB → External API) with 0.3s cache response capability
- ✅ **Telegram Channel Integration**: Successfully connected to Channel -1002863131570 with bot authentication working
- ✅ **Background Upload System**: Cache upload functionality confirmed operational with retry mechanisms
- ✅ **MongoDB Atlas Connection**: Real-time database operations with proper connection pooling to cluster mongodb+srv://jaydipmore74:xCpTm5OPAfRKYnif@cluster0.5jo18.mongodb.net
- ✅ **API Endpoints Functional**: All /api/v1/ routes working with rate limiting and API key validation
- ✅ **Admin Panel Operational**: Real-time dashboard, API key management, and system monitoring working
- ✅ **Replit Migration Completed**: Successfully migrated from Replit Agent to native Replit environment
- ✅ **MongoDB-Only Architecture**: Streamlined to use MongoDB exclusively, removed SQL dependencies

- ✅ **Python Usage Documentation**: Comprehensive examples for both sync and async API usage (USAGE.md, examples/)
- ✅ **Real Data Processing**: All 5 API functions work with authentic YouTube content, no mock data
- ✅ **High-Performance Connection Pooling**: Optimized HTTP sessions with keepalive and professional headers

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Database preference: MongoDB only (migrated from mixed SQL/NoSQL setup).
Project usage: Focus on Python integration and API usage examples.
System requirements: Ultra-fast Telegram caching (0.3s response), no duplicate downloads, dynamic bot token/channel ID support, always highest quality downloads.

# System Architecture

## Core Framework and Structure
- **Flask Web Framework**: Primary application framework with Blueprint-based modular architecture
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Uses asyncio and Motor (async MongoDB driver) for high-performance database operations
- **Connection Pooling**: Configured for 100 max pool connections to support high concurrency requirements

## Authentication and Authorization
- **API Key-based Authentication**: Custom API key system with rate limiting (1000 requests/hour default)
- **Admin Panel Authentication**: Simple username/password authentication with session management
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-API-key rate limiting with MongoDB tracking of usage statistics

## Data Storage Architecture
- **MongoDB Primary Database**: Stores users, API keys, usage statistics, content cache metadata, and concurrent user tracking
- **Collections Structure**:
  - `users`: User account management
  - `api_keys`: API key storage and configuration
  - `usage_stats`: Request tracking and analytics
  - `content_cache`: Telegram-cached content metadata
  - `concurrent_users`: Real-time user session tracking

## Content Delivery System
- **YouTube Download Service**: Custom downloader with AES-CBC decryption capabilities
- **Telegram CDN Integration**: Uses Telegram as a content delivery network for caching downloaded videos
- **Streaming Support**: Direct video streaming endpoints with range request support
- **Multi-quality Support**: Handles different video qualities and formats

## Performance and Scalability
- **Connection Pooling**: HTTP client connection pooling with 1000 max connections
- **Concurrent User Management**: Designed to handle 10,000+ simultaneous users
- **Real-time Analytics**: Live dashboard updates with 30-second refresh intervals
- **Caching Strategy**: Telegram-based content caching to reduce API calls and improve response times

## Admin Interface
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Live metrics showing concurrent users, API usage, and system health
- **API Key Management**: Create, activate/deactivate, and monitor API keys
- **Analytics Panel**: Detailed usage statistics with configurable time periods
- **System Monitoring**: Health checks and performance metrics

## Error Handling and Logging
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Custom logging utility with structured output
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Proper error responses with meaningful messages
- **Health Check Endpoints**: System status monitoring for deployment health
